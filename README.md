# Logistic Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) — Explained! 📊🤖

### 1. The Problem Setup 🎯

- You have features (input variables):

$$
\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]
$$ 🔢

- You want to predict a binary label:

$$
y \in \{0,1\}
$$

(e.g., spam or not spam) 📨❌✅

### 2. The Logistic Model 🔍

- Compute the linear combination of features and weights plus a bias:

$$
z = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b = \sum_{j=1}^n w_j x_j + b
$$

where:  
- $$ \mathbf{w} $$ = weights ⚖️  
- $$ b $$ = bias (intercept) 🎯  
- $$ \mathbf{x} $$ = features 🧮  

- Pass this through the sigmoid function (also called logistic function) to squash it into a probability between 0 and 1:

$$
\hat{y} = \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}
$$

The sigmoid acts as a soft switch 🔄 transforming linear values into probabilities.

### 3. Making Predictions 🤔

- $$ \hat{y} $$ is the predicted probability that the data point belongs to class 1.
- Decision boundary with threshold 0.5:  
  - If $$ \hat{y} \geq 0.5 $$, predict class 1 ✅  
  - Else, predict class 0 ❌

### 4. How Do We Know If Predictions Are Good? 📉

- Use the binary cross-entropy loss (log loss) to measure error:

$$
L = - \big( y \log(\hat{y}) + (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y}) \big)
$$

- Intuition:  
  - If prediction $$ \hat{y} $$ is close to true label $$ y $$, loss is low ✔️  
  - If it's far, loss is high ❌

### 5. Learning by Updating Parameters — Gradient Descent 🔄

- To minimize the loss, adjust weights and bias using gradients (derivatives indicating how to reduce error).
- For one training example $$ (\mathbf{x_i}, y_i) $$, the gradients are:

For weight $$ w_j $$:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial w_j} = (\hat{y}_i - y_i) x_{ij}
$$

For bias $$ b $$:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial b} = \hat{y}_i - y_i
$$

### 6. What’s Stochastic Gradient Descent? ⚡️

- **Batch Gradient Descent** computes gradients over the *entire* dataset before updating parameters.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** updates parameters *after every single training example* immediately after computing its gradient.
  
This stochasticity often helps:  
- Faster convergence 🏃‍♂️  
- Ability to escape shallow local minima 🚀  
- Effective for large datasets 📊

### 7. SGD Update Equations 💡

For each training example:

- Update weights:

$$
w_j := w_j - \eta \cdot (\hat{y}_i - y_i) \cdot x_{ij}
$$

- Update bias:

$$
b := b - \eta \cdot (\hat{y}_i - y_i)
$$

where:  
- $$ \eta $$ = learning rate (small positive number) 📉 controlling update size.

### 8. Example 🧑‍🏫

Suppose for one sample:

| Variable         | Value               | Explanation                  |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| Feature vector   | $$ \mathbf{x} =  $$  | Inputs/features                 |
| True label      | $$ y = 1 $$              | The actual class               |
| Current weights | $$ \mathbf{w} = [0.1, -0.2] $$ | Model's current weights          |
| Bias            | $$ b = 0.05 $$            | Model's current bias            |
| Learning rate   | $$ \eta = 0.1 $$          | Step size for updates          |

**Step 1: Calculate linear output**

$$
z = 0.1 \times 2 + (-0.2) \times 3 + 0.05 = 0.2 - 0.6 + 0.05 = -0.35
$$

**Step 2: Compute predicted probability**

$$
\hat{y} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{0.35}} \approx 0.413
$$

**Step 3: Calculate error**

$$
\hat{y} - y = 0.413 - 1 = -0.587
$$

**Step 4: Update weights**

$$
w_1 = 0.1 - 0.1 \times (-0.587) \times 2 = 0.1 + 0.1174 = 0.2174
$$

$$
w_2 = -0.2 - 0.1 \times (-0.587) \times 3 = -0.2 + 0.1761 = -0.0239
$$

**Step 5: Update bias**

$$
b = 0.05 - 0.1 \times (-0.587) = 0.1087
$$

🎯 This update moves parameters closer to minimizing error for this sample.

### 9. Repeat Over Dataset & Epochs 🔁

- Process each training example similarly, updating weights immediately.
- Shuffle the data each epoch to improve learning and avoid cycles 🔀.
- After many epochs, the model converges to the weights minimizing the loss.
