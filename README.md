Logistic Regression with Stochastic GradientDescent (SGD) — Explained! 📊 🤖
1. The Problem Setup 🎯
You have
features
(input variables):
$ \mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] $ 🔢
You want to predict a binary
label
(e.g., spam or not spam) 📨 ❌✅
2. The Logistic Model 🔍
Compute the linear combination of features and weights plus a bias:
where:
= weights ⚖️ ⚖️
= bias (intercept) 🎯
= features 🧮
Pass this through the
sigmoid function
(also called logistic function) to squash into aprobability between 0 and 1:
The sigmoid looks like a soft switch 🔄 turning linear inputs into probabilities.
3. Making Predictions 🤔
is now the model’s predicted
probability
that the data point belongs to class 1.
Decision boundary with threshold 0.5:
If $ \hat{y} \geq 0.5 $, predict class 1 ✅
Else, predict class 0 ❌
For each training example:
Where:
4. How Do We Know If Predictions Are Good? 📉
Use the
binary cross-entropy loss (log loss)
to measure error:
Intuition:
If prediction
is close to true label
, loss is low ✔️ ✔️
If it's far, loss is high ❌
5. Learning by Updating Parameters — Gradient Descent 🔄
To minimize the loss, adjust weights and bias using
gradients
(derivatives indicating how tochange values to reduce error).
For one training example $ (\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) $, the gradients are:
For weight
:
For bias
:
6. What’s
Stochastic Gradient Descent
? ⚡️ ⚡️
Batch Gradient Descent
computes gradients over the entire dataset each time beforeupdating.
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
updates parameters for
every single training example
immediately after computing its gradient.
This “stochastic” (random) step often helps:
Faster convergence 🏃 ♂️🏃 ♂️🏃 ♂️
Escapes shallow local minima 🚀
Works well with large datasets 📊
7. SGD Update Equations 💡
Update weights:
Update bias:
= learning rate (small positive number) 📉 — controls how big the update step is.
Imagine the following for one sample:
Variable
Value
Explanation
Feature vector
$ \mathbf{x} =

Inputs/features
True label
The actual class
Current weights
$ \mathbf{w} = [0.1, -0.2] $
Model's current weights
Bias
Model's current bias
Learning rate
$ \eta = 0.1 $
Step size for updates
Step 1:
Calculate linear output:
Step 2:
Compute predicted probability:
Step 3:
Calculate error:
Step 4:
Update weights:
Step 5:
Update bias:
This update nudges parameters closer to minimizing error for this example! 🎯

[
2]
$ w_1 = 0.1 - 0.1 \times (-0.587) \times 2 = 0.1 + 0.1174 = 0.2174 $
$ w_2 = -0.2 - 0.1 \times (-0.587) \times 3 = -0.2 + 0.1761 = -0.0239 $
9. Repeat Over Dataset & Epochs 🔁
Process
each training example
similarly, updating weights immediately.
Shuffle the data each epoch to improve learning and avoid cycles 🔀 .
After many epochs, the model converges to weights that best classify the data.
